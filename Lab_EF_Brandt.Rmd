## Q1. What size N seems to make the bimodal distribution look normal?
   
   * The greater the N, the more normal the distribution appears. The three images below show how the distribution becomes normal as N increases from 1 to 3 to 6. An N of 1 most prominently shows the bimodal distribution becacuse each sample's average equals the one sample. As the N increases, the distribution of each sample is the average of the N samples, so the distribution is distributed around the mean of the two modes. By about N = 5 or N = 6, the bimodal distribution appears normal.

  **N = 1**
```{r, out.width="250px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/biomodal_1.jpg")

```

  
  
  **N = 3**
```{r, out.width="250px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/bimodal_3.jpg")

```
 
  
  
  
  
  **N = 6**
```{r, out.width="250px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/bimodal_6.jpg")


```
  
  
  
  

## Q2. Monte Carlo simulation of the variance b
  
  For this part of the assignment, I used the MonteCalo package in R.
  The link which explains the functionality of this package can be found [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MonteCarlo/vignettes/MonteCarlo-Vignette.html)
  
  
```{r}
